# Global Covid-19 Analysis

## About the Project
### This project examines global covid-19 statistics, with an emphasis on vaccinations. The data comes from Our World in Data. SQL was used for cleaning the data and creating views for visualization, and I connected those views to PowerBI in order to create a dashboard.

## Disclaimer 
### This a guided project from Alex the Analyst, so credit for most of the code goes to him. I have added additional metrics beyond what Alex included in his tutorial, such as GDP per capita. The dashboard is also unique to me.
